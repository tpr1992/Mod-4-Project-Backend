###NHTSA Search Engine Backend

To start, please run rails s on port 3000, and `npm start` for the frontend. 

This is my mod 4 project from Flatiron School and is intended to search the database of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for all car makes and models from the past ~50 years.

The backend is built in Rails and holds user data for their account and favorite cars.

The frontend can be found here - https://github.com/tpr1992/Mod-4-Project-Frontend
